title: Deprecating Dev Branch
description: Will directly merge each feature branch to main going forwards.

### tldr

> I used to have versioning system where I used a dev branch as the branch holding my most up to date updates. Any new feature branch would be first rebased with dev branch. And after I feel the current changes in dev are stable and or needed in prod I would rebase and merge dev with main. Going forwards I'm no longer going to have a dev branch for reasons.

## My Previous Workflow

I version my code with github, and my workflow has been as follows. First init a proj, with main branch as root.
Then create a dev branch, as a permanent branch where all staged changes will be rebased from and merged to.
This means that the most "current" version of my (working) projects always live in dev branch. And then
peridodically I would merge changes in dev to main to update production build.

## Why I Used this workflow

- Was more expedient.
  - Main branch is always protected from direct push, so don't really feel like creating a pull request
    for my own projects with every commit.
- ## Felt I need this.
