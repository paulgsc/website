### Title: Coding Stream - Building Landing Page

#### Description:

Welcome to my coding livestream! Today, we will be building a landing page from scratch, and I'll walk you through every step of the process. Our goal is to create a VPS/self-hosted site that runs intermittently to minimize costs and avoid paywalls. We're leveraging open-source tools and writing our own solutions where necessary to ensure complete freedom from service charges.

**Key Points:**

- **Purpose of the Site:**
  We're creating a VPS/self-hosted website that operates on a schedule, minimizing operational costs and avoiding any paywalls. This project is entirely open-source, ensuring that we maintain control and transparency throughout the development process.
- **What We'll Cover:**
  Just watching me try to fix my landing page.
- Current issue is that I'm using a tab that overflows on small screens,
- So I need to make it become a dropdown with a drawer on mobile for tab selection.
- If I'm able to finish that then I'll implement a slider using embla package and shadcn
